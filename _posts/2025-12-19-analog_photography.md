Sharing some photos I took with my Olympus Stylus point-and-shoot, and a disposable Fujifilm camera...

When looking at film photos, I often think of "spirit photography". In the 19th century, spirit photography was performed—intentionally or not—by capturing noise, double exposures, and transient *human* figures which appeared otherworldly in resulting photographs. The scientific process of creating photographs (i.e. use of chemicals for developing photos) lent empirical credibility to the interpretation that unintended phenomena in spirit photos were indeed spectres:

> The idea that people, places, and objects could somehow leave behind—cause, in fact—their own images gave photography a key role as evidence... Essential to the belief system which photography engendered was the fact that the image was created by a physical process over which human craft exerted no decisive role.

Spirit photography, to me, highlights how digital images no longer hold the same credibility in documenting people, places and events. Modern interpretation of digital images is complex, but overall I appreciate how the process of capturing and processing film photos is more understandable than that of digital photos with complicated ISPs.
